/* An alternative "w" program for Linux.
 * Shows users and their processes.
 *
 * Info:
 *	I starting writing as an improvement of the w program included
 * with linux. The idea was to add in some extra functionality to the
 * program, and see if I could fix a couple of bugs which seemed to
 * occur.
 *						Mr. Bassman, 10/94

 * Compilation:

 * Revision 1.1  2002/02/01 22:46:37  csmall
 * Initial revision
 *
 * Revision 1.5  1994/10/26  17:57:35  bassman
 * Loads of stuff - see comments.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  1994/01/01  12:57:21  johnsonm
 * Added RCS, and some other fixes.
 *
 * Revision history:
 * Jan 01, 1994 (mkj):	Eliminated GCC warnings, took out unnecessary
 *			dead variables in fscanf, replacing them with
 *			*'d format qualifiers.  Also added RCS stuff.
 * Oct 26, 1994 (bass):	Tidied up the code, fixed bug involving corrupt
 *			utmp records.  Added switch for From field;
 *			default is compile-time set.  Added -d option
 *			as a remnant from BSD 'w'.  Fixed bug so it now
 *			behaves if the first process on a tty isn't owned
 *			by the person first logged in on that tty, and
 *			also detects su'd users.  Changed the tty format
 *			to the short one.
