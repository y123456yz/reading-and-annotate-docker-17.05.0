.SH NAME
w \- Show who is logged on and what they are doing.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B w
[\fIoptions\fR] \fIuser\fR [...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B w
displays information about the users currently on the machine, and their
processes.  The header shows, in this order, the current time, how long the
system has been running, how many users are currently logged on, and the
system load averages for the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes.
.PP
The following entries are displayed for each user: login name, the tty name,
the remote host, login time, idle time, JCPU, PCPU, and the command line of
their current process.
.PP
The JCPU time is the time used by all processes attached to the tty.  It does
not include past background jobs, but does include currently running
background jobs.
.PP
The PCPU time is the time used by the current process, named in the "what"
field.
